And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by his spell and The Mariner tells his tale.  Driven south to the land of the snow and ice To a place where nobody's been Through the snow fog flies on the albatross Hailed in God's name, Hoping good luck it brings.  And the ship sails on, back to the north Through the fog and ice and The albatross follows on  The mariner kills the bird of good omen His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves part of the crime.  Sailing on and on and North across the sea Sailing on and on and North till all is calm.  The albatross begins with its vengeance A terrible curse a thirst has begun His shipmates blame the bad luck on the Mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  And the curse goes on and on and on at sea, And the thirst goes on and on for them and me.  ""Day after day, day after day, We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water everywhere and All the boards did shrink Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  There, calls the Mariner, There comes a ship over the line But how can she sail with no wind In her sails and no tide.  See... onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See... she has no crew She has no life, wait but there's two  Death and she life in Death, They throw their dice for the crew She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now. Then... crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She... She, Life in Death, She lets him live, her chosen one.  ""One after one by the star dogged moon, Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men (And I heard nor sigh nor groan), With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, They dropped down one by one.""  The curse it lives on in their eyes The Mariner he wished he'd die Along with the sea creatures But they lived on, so did he.  And by the light of the moon He prays for their beauty not doom With heart he blesses them God's creatures all of them too  Then the spell starts to break The albatross falls from his neck Sinks down like lead into the sea Then down in falls comes the rain Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  Hear the groans of the long dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak And they're lifeless in their eyes.  And revenge is still sought, penance starts again Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  Now the curse is finally lifted And the Mariner sights his home Spirits go from the long dead bodies Form their own light and The Mariner's left alone.

"Its 2002, everything was totally new We were globally huge Watching sales go through the roof We wrote and we viewed it Runyon Avenue soldiers included A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse We were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth Thought we was running shit till we lost the sole of our shoe The death of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do And at the time I was going through my own struggles too So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew I was hoping they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group  If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind  I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  It was never the same, and it's bothered me since And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets The more time goes by, the more life happens And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did More than try talking you into coming up off of it I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers I wish that we would've politicked with Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features But that's water under the bridge But I'm washing my sins in it till my conscious is clear  If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind  I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  Bacardi in hand Never thought the party would end One minute you're bodyin' shit but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is starting to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch To tiny drops full of drips And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift All the carnage you left Is this the kinda karma you get? For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip Subconsciously, I honestly wished I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this Wish I had words  But I guess they're just ownin' for this Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you, men But I just can't be the guy Everybody depends on for entire careers 'Cause that's not even fair I will always be here But that spark isn't there And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air I've tried hearkening back to But I'm fighting for air I'm barely charting myself Feels like I'm under the sink  But it was not my intent To treat y'all like a stepping stone Though I ain't left no one behind But we been down every road Done all we possibly can I know we kept up our hopes But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live The less is left for closure, so let's let this go It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over  I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones",stepping stone,kamikaze,eminem,rap

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind  We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us  We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus  To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is  To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is  But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered  It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it  Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further   But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'  I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause  Step by step, heart to heart, left right left  We all fall down like toy soldiers  Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win  But the battle wages on for toy soldiers",like toy soldiers,encore,eminem,rap

Now before you walk in the door Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer You'd better think of the consequence (But who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience.  Eminem That's nonsense. Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs. (Can I borrow this?)

Are you that rich? Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch? Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?  Dr. Dre Man, don't do it. It's not worth it to risk it. (You're right.) Not over this shit. (Stop!) Drop the biscuit. (I will!) Don't even listen to Slim, yo. He's bad for you.  Eminem You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude.

Dr. Dre Yo, this girl's only 15 years old. You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair.  Eminem Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh-huh.)

"Under an old brass paper weight, Is my list of things to do today: Go to the bank and the hardware store, Put a new lock on the cellar door.

"The First Noel the angel did say Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay; In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep, On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, Born is the King of Israel.  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the east beyond them far, And to the earth it gave great light, And so it continued both day and night.  And by the light of that same star Three wise men came from country far; To seek for a king was their intent, And to follow the star wherever it went.  This star drew nigh to the northwest, O'er Bethlehem it took it rest, And there it did both stop and stay Right over the place where Jesus lay.  Then entered in those wise men three Full reverently upon their knee, And offered there in his presence Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord; That hath made heaven and earth of naught, And with his blood mankind hath bought",the first noel,a toby keith classic christmas volume two,toby keith,country

"Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace, Await their place within the ring of calm; Still stand to turn in seconds of release, Await the call they know may never come. In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon To jeopardize the course, upset the run; And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun As love in the halls of plenty overrun.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, Unending dances shadowed on the day. Within their walls, their daunting formless keep, Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep, Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray; And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, But no one seemed to question in anyway.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land To seek the unsuspecting and the weak; And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand Toward the foe that threatened from the deep. Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' And the Lord there in heaven would never preach.  I'm singin', Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Where was your word, where did you go? Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow.  Dull is the armor, cold is the day. Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way.  I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh. I couldn't stand it another day, another day, Another day-ay, day-ay, another day, another day.  Touched by the timely coming, Roused from the keeper's sleep, Release the grip, throw down the key.  Held now within the knowing, Rest now within the peace. Take of the fruit, but guard the seed.  They had to stay!  Held now within the knowing, Rest now within the beat. Take of the fruit, but guard the seed.  Oh, take of the fruit, but guard the seed.",carouselambra,in through the out door,led zeppelin,rock
