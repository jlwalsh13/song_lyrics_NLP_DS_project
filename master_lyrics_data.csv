"Orphan of the road (Dick Feller) "" © '71 House of Cash""  From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three-day stand, A cowboy met a fiery carny queen In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van. They laughed and loved and shared short-lived dreams, But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways, And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on, And I was born on a winter morn to the dark-eyed carny queen, The too-late son of something that was gone, The black-sheep child that grew up wild from the seed the four winds sowed, Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road.  I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes, So I was left to grow up on my own, Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try. So mostly I was mostly left alone. In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps, I joined the men who drift from town to town. The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins. I'd never find the time to settle down. The black-sheep child...  In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town, And I pulled myself into the boxcar door. In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form Of an old man lying sick upon the floor. And he said ""I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died, And that she'd left an only son behind, And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace If I could just see him once before I die."" I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame, Then I held it close and I gently raised his head. ""My mother, sir,"" I said of her, ""I have her same dark eyes."" He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead. The black-sheep child...

We all were called to come back to the old home on the farm Mother's passed away what a mournful day And as my daddy watched his eyes were filled with pain and hurt When someone stepped upon a rose and crush it in the dirt Don't step on mother's roses daddy cried she planted them the day she was my bride And every time I see a rose I see her smilin' face She made my darkest days look bright round the old homeplace Don't step on mother's roses let them grow The way they did since many years ago They'll bloom for me each year and I'll have mother near Don't step on mother's roses let them grow Years have passed away and how the old homeplace has changed Daddy had to go we all miss him so Children pick the roses as they go along the way But when their petals are abused I hear my daddy say Don't step on mother's roses...,don't step on mother's roses,songs of our soil,johnny cash,country
What a beautiful thought I am thinking Concerning a great speckled bird Remember her name is recorded On the pages of God's Holy Word  All the other birds are flocking 'round her And she is despised by the squad But the great speckled bird in the Bible Is one with the great church of God  All the other churches are against her They envy her glory and fame They hate her because she is chosen And has not denied Jesus' name  Desiring to lower her standard They watch every move that she makes They long to find fault with her teachings But really they find no mistake  She is spreading her wings for a journey She's going to leave by and by When the trumpet shall sound in the morning She'll rise and go up in the sky  In the presence of all her despisers With a song never uttered before She will rise and be gone in a moment 'Til the great tribulation is o'er  I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am proud that my name is on her book For I want to be one never fearing The face of my Savior to look  When He cometh descending from heaven On the cloud that He writes in His Word I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him On the wings of that great speckled bird,great speckled bird,songs of our soil,johnny cash,country
My grandfather's clock was too tall for the shelf So it stood ninety years on the floor It was taller by half than the old man himself Though it weighed not a pennyweight more It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born And was always his treasure and pride But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died Ninety years without slumbering his life second's numbering It stopped short never to go again when the old man died My grandfather said that of those he could hire Not a servant so faithful he found For it wasted no time and had but one desire At the close of each week to be wound And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face And its hands never hung by its side But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night An alarm that for years had been dumb And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight That his hour for departure had come Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime As we silently stood by his side But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died Ninety years without slumbering...,my grandfather's clock,songs of our soil,johnny cash,country

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day So he said let's run and have some fun now before I melt away Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye saying don't you cry I'll be back again some day,frosty the snowman,pretty paper,willie nelson,country
