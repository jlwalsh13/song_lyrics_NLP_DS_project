Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
These're the thoughts and the words of a man ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He was a young man when he first came to prison ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin' ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
But never did he stop looking and waitin' ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
With the look of a child awaiting a reward ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin' ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Somehow feel the lump in his throat ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Just outside the prison walls ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
The man that they buried today had died many times ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
Somebody cared for him ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
No matter how terrible his crime might have been ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
The death he died from today was more inhuman ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit ,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you Mrs,dear mrs.,man in black,johnny cash,country

Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool,fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop

"When all you wanted, was to be wanted",fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
"Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now",fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday,fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind ,fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
And we both cried,fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
"'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them",fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall",fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop
"I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be",fifteen,fearless,taylor swift,pop

"When your birthday passed, and I didn't call",back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times",back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
I watched you laughing from the passenger side,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
And realized I loved you in the fall,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
And then the cold came,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
The dark days when fear crept into my mind,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop

And how you held me in your arms that September night,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
The first time you ever saw me cry,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
Maybe this is wishful thinking,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
Probably mindless dreaming,back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right",back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
"So if the chain is on your door, I understand",back to december,speak now,taylor swift,pop
